# Vault Enterprise Best Practices Cluster

~> **Important Note:** This chart is not compatible with Helm 3. Please use Helm 2 with this chart.

This example of using Helm with Vault Enterprise is currently intentionally vague. We are in the
active process of writing and testing a best practices Helm configuration, which will address
recommendations around replications.

In the meantime, for those comfortable enough with Helm and Kubernetes to handle those details
independently, we offer this information.

In your Helm config, you may pull the Vault Enterprise Docker image
for use like so:

```yaml
image:
    repository: "hashicorp/vault-enterprise"
    tag: "1.3.1_ent"
```

~> **Important Note:** Only non-HSM images are supported. Image tags ending with ".hsm" will not work.
